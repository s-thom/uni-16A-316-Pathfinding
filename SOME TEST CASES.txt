; These commands were used during development for testing purposes. They *should*
; still work, but that's not guaranteed.

; Expand an empty map by one step
(expand-astar '(("-" "-" "-")("-" "-" "-")) (give-start-list {:x 0 :y 0}) '() {:x 2 :y 1})

; Same as above, but with reduced info
(map reduce-info (expand-astar '(("-" "-" "-")("-" "-" "-")) (give-start-list {:x 0 :y 0}) '() {:x 2 :y 1}))

; Testing the `pos-of` function
(pos-of "v" '(("*" "-" "-")("-" "-" "v")("-" "-" "-")))
(pos-of "v" '(("-" "-" "-")("-" "-" "-")("-" "-" "-")))

; Actual working commands, can be used for testing (although I'm sure you have sxcripts for this)
(astar :scenario :easy :print-states true)
(dfs :scenario :easy :print-states true)
